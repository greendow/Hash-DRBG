# Hash-DRBG
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A **DRBG**(Deterministic Random Bit Generator) is used to obtain pseudorandom bits for different purposes. In NIST SP 800-90A Revision 1 'Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators', the following three constructions of DRBG are provided: Hash\_DRBG, HMAC\_DRBG and CTR\_DRBG. The secret key is not required in the hash DRBG. The problem of key storage is avoided. But the modular arithmetic of big number results in its low efficiency. CTR\_DRBG is preferred when performance is more important to users.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The hash DRBG is defined in chapter 10.1.1 of NIST SP 800-90A Rev.1.1. An implementation based on big number arithmetic provided by OpenSSL 1.1.1 is given here. Header files and library files of OpenSSL 1.1.1 is needed while compiling and linking. OpenSSL website is: [https://www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org)  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The security strength of DRBG is determined by the hash algorithm used. This implementation only supports hash functions whose output length is 256-bit or 512-bit. SHA-1 is deprecated for its insecurity. Only SHA-256 or SHA-512 can be used as the building block for DRBG here. As noted in NIST SP 800-90A, there is no efficiency benefit when using SHA-224 rather than SHA-256 since SHA-224 is based on SHA-256. Similarly, there is no efficiency benefit for using SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 rather than using SHA-512 since these three SHA mechanisms are based on SHA-512. A structure called EVP\_MD is employed to specify the hash function. EVP\_MD is defined in OpenSSL. Such a structure implies that any hash function can be used to build the hash DRBG as long as its output length is 256-bit or 512-bit. For example, SHA3-256 and SHA3-512 are not included in NIST SP 800-90A, but either of them can be used to build a non-standard hash DRBG in certain circumstances.  
Note:  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There is a macro of '\_HASH_DRBG_DEBUG' in hash\_drbg.h. It is undefined at default. The macro is defined for displaying intermediate values in debug process. It **MUST** be undefined in final release! Make sure that it is **UNDEFINED**!
